## SPARC Workflow (Specification → Pseudocode → Architecture → Refinement → Completion)

- **Specification**: Capture the exact requirement and constraints in 2–4 bullet points.
- **Pseudocode**: Outline the algorithm/flow briefly before coding.
- **Architecture**: Identify files/modules to touch and interfaces.
- **Refinement**: Implement with small, verifiable steps; keep edits minimal.
- **Completion**: Validate via tests/lint; summarize high-impact changes.

Notes for assistants/tools:

- Think step-by-step internally; expose only concise reasoning relevant to the change.
- Keep code snippets minimal and scoped; avoid unrelated changes.
- Provide brief status updates for progress and next action during a session.
