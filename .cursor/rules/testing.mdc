## Testing and TDD Rules

- **TDD cadence**

  - Write a small failing test.
  - Implement the minimal code to pass.
  - Refactor safely with tests green.

- **Scope**

  - Prefer fast unit tests; add integration tests for critical flows.
  - Keep tests deterministic and isolated; avoid network/FS unless mocked.

- **Quality**

  - Assert behavior and edge cases, not implementation details.
  - Name tests to describe behavior succinctly.

- **Automation**
  - Run tests after substantive edits and before marking tasks complete.
  - Fix linter/type errors before commit.
