## Style Rules

- **Formatting**

  - Match existing files’ indentation; do not convert tabs ↔ spaces.
  - Keep line length reasonable (aim ≤ 100 unless project requires otherwise).
  - Do not reformat unrelated lines during edits.

- **Naming**

  - Use descriptive, full-word names; avoid abbreviations.
  - Functions: verbs/verb-phrases. Variables: nouns/noun-phrases.

- **Control flow**

  - Prefer early returns and shallow nesting.
  - Handle edge cases first; avoid unnecessary try/catch.
  - Never catch errors without meaningful handling.

- **Comments**

  - Comment only when non-obvious; explain "why", not "how".
  - No inline narration comments inside code for editor actions.

- **Consistency**
  - Match surrounding code style and formatting.
  - Use multi-line over dense one-liners when it improves readability.
